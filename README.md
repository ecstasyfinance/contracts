# Ecstasy

Based on the fee structure of Safemoon Protocol, Ecstasy is designed to deliver larger payouts to selected wallets each week.

Rather than redistributing fees at the time of transfer, fees are collected throughout the week to create a prize pool to be distributed to random wallets at the end of the week. Wallets with larger balances have a greater probability of winning, but everybody has a chance.
