# Ecstasy

Based on RFI, Ecstasy takes a transaction fee from each transfer. 2% will be immediately distributed to other holders of the token and 3% will be added to a "pot" that will be transferred to one lucky winner at the end of each week. The logic behind the pot is very similar to the way SAFEMOON extracts liquidity, however, we will distribute the collected fees directly to lottery winners.
