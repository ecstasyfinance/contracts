# Ecstasy

Based on RFI, Ecstasy takes a transaction fee from each transfer. 2% will be immediately distributed to other holders of the token and 3% will be added to a "pot" that will be transferred to one lucky winner at the end of each week. The logic behind this is very similar to the way SAFEMOON extracts liquidity, however, we will distribute the collected fees directly to lottery winners.

While these winners are selected randomly, holders with larger stakes have a higher probability of winning. After winning a pot, the address will be excluded from the following week's lottery to give other accounts a chance to win.
